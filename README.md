# VideosContentSimulatorCPP
This is a final project i did for school.
It basically simulates a video content platform. 

The program obtains some users data from a .txt file and it also obtains a list of tv shows from another .txt file.

The tv shows are implemented in two types (movies and episodes), through inheritance.

The program starts with a menu made with a loop, there you can choose between: consult available videos, consult videos according to a rating, consult a video according to a genre, display the users data, modify the users profile, add a video to some users list and exit.

This exercise contains C++ basics such as inheritance, funtions, classes, files, pointers, abstraction and polymorphism.
