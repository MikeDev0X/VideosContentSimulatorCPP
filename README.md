# VideosContentSimulatorCPP
This is a final project i did for school.
It basically simulates a video content platform; the program obtains some users data from a .txt file and it also obtains a list of tv shows from another .txt file.
The tv shows are implemented in two types (movies and episodes), through inheritance.

When excecuting, you can modify the list of tvshows for a specific user, and modify the user's name or password.

This exercise contains C++ basics such as inheritance, funtions, classes, files, pointers and polymorphism.
